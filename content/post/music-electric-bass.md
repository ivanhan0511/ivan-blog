I'm super excited when getting my first music equipment at 39 years old. It's a Squier CV 70s Jazz Bass.

And I think I have enough courage to keep playing with it.

## TODO LIST
- [x] Hold it correctly
- [x] Connect it with amplifier correctly and make them noisy, because my env is a little complicate
- [x] Clean it correctly after playing
- [ ] Make tone tuning quickly and correctly each time
- [ ] Balance the two fingers strength of my right hand, and even the angle of the two fingers
- [ ] Open the four fingers of my left hand
